## **Overview**
This repo contains libraries, algorithms, techniques, projects and courses that have helped me stregthen my understanding of this domain. This is more so to document my learning experience and what I found helpful in understand the diffeerences across algorithms/techniques/libraries/frameworks conceptually as well as implementation wise. The order of courses also helped me build my foundational knowledge to more advanced to more niche applications. If the organization of content helps someone else in their Machine Learning journey than even better.
